For Duo and other human interaction authentication

https://duo.com/docs/fortinet#configure-your-fortinet-fortigate-ssl-vpn

default value is 5 seconds

Configure timeout
The Fortinet appliance has a default timeout of 5 seconds, which will fail for anything other than a passcode authentication. The timeout can be increased from the Fortinet command line interface to resolve the issue. Duo recommends increasing the timeout to at least 60 seconds

Connect to the appliance CLI. Consult the documentation that accompanied your Fortinet device for more information.
Execute the following commands:
config system global
set remoteauthtimeout 60
end



if not done, error message that appears in Log & Report -> Events -> VPN

Action	ssl-login-fail
Reason	sslvpn_login_no_matching_policy

or


Action	ssl-login-fail
Reason	sslvpn_login_permission_denied
